# Vaesea's SuperTux
A fork of SuperTux where I hope to replace all the graphics and levels with my own, for the simple reason of: I just want to do that.

Tux will also be a replaced by a new character but I haven't decided what yet, it would most likely be based on Tux though.

The art style will most likely be based on either an art style similar to Tux Junior or the old SuperTux art style. There will probably be references to old SuperTux things. Maybe I might try make art in my own style! Who knows...

## Story: Nolok is doing something evil!
Tux was in his igloo, when he noticed a note. It was the news for the day, and it said that a strange creature named "Nolok" was creating a factory in the forest that uses helpless forest creatures to power the machines! So now, Tux must make his way to the forest to stop this Nolok guy!

Why does everything look different? Well, this happens in a different universe. Also in this universe, Tux never had to save Penny, so he doesn't know about Nolok until the story begins.

This story is inspired by the Forest World Adventure Pack story, and the graphics for the forest world are likely gonna be inspired by Tux Junior or Forest World Adventure Pack, although Icy Island's replacement, Snow Land, will be more like the original DifferentTux, likely with the purple ice.
